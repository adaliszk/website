With the many various requirements over the year, I have been fine-tuning, evolving my own setup to deploy environments
and applications. This repository contains my frequently used abstractions and configurations alongside of a few tools
and framework extensions that aims to aid efficient workflows.

The idea here is to provide modular packages that can deploy a whole environment stack for a particular application
or environment. Separate each use-case into their scope and allow customisation through an exposed configuration.
Essentially, creating a deployment ecosystem like how vite creates a compiler ecosystem.

Pulumi enables these setups to be packaged up and shared through NPM, PyPi,
and [eventually Crates](https://github.com/pulumi/pulumi/issues/11882). It also allows
greater flexibility as the deployments can be manipulated based on common programming structures while keeping it stable
with deep and accurate testing support.

## Prerequisites

- [`bun.js`](https://bun.sh) as the environment and workspace manager
- [`dagger`](https://dagger.io) for automation runner and orchestrator
- [`ansible`](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible) for server configurations
- [`flux`](https://fluxcd.io/flux/installation) as git-ops automation for all environments
- [`docker`](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker) for building custom images
- [`pulumi`](https://www.pulumi.com/docs/get-started/install) for deployment automation

## Structure

- `/configs`: ansible playbooks for bootstrapping servers
- `/deployments`:
- `/environments`: environment configurations for shared resources
- `/images`: unofficial docker images to help cloud environments
- `/packages`: deployment packages to orchestrate environments

## GitOps

Currently, there are four layers of automation within the project:

1. Flux CD: synchronise the baseline setup to all clusters
2. Pulumi: deployment modules and cluster configurations to be executed
3. GitLab CI: automation tool for the whole code lifecycle
